# Template Project

## Usage

To use the template do the following steps:

1. Copy the project folder
2. Rename to your desired project-name
3. Delete the .git folder
4. Run: "git init"

After running these steps you will have a fresh git repositorys without the history of the template

## Project description

The Project consits of a single page with different sections about my home town.

## Installation

## Configuration

The project was used to learn how to dynamically add content to the dom with javascript

## Dependencies

The project uses HTML, CSS and Javascript.
No libraries or third-party-tools are used.

## Structure

## Documenation

The documentation is built with JsDoc, see in:

    /docs/index.html

You can create the documentation by running one of the following commands in the terminal.

For a single File:

    jsdoc filename.js

For the whole directory:

    jsdoc ./ -r

## TODO

Add script to package.json to add the correct config file to the repo

    {
        "scripts": {
        "doc": "jsdoc -c jsdoc.conf.json"
        }
    }

Thanks for reading
